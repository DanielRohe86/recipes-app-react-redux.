# Deliverables

<details>
   <summary><strong>ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to deliver</strong></summary><br />

   To deliver your project you must create a *Pull Request* in this repository.

   Remember that you can consult our content on [Git & GitHub](https://app.betrybe.com/course/4d67f5b4-34a6-489f-a205-b6c7dc50fc16/) and our [Blog - Git & GitHub](https ://blog.betrybe.com/tecnologia/git-e-github/) whenever you need it!
</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>üë®‚Äçüíª What should be developed</strong></summary><br />

   You will develop a recipe app, using the most modern features within the React ecosystem: Hooks and Context API!

   It will be possible to: view, search, filter, favorite and monitor the progress of preparing food and drink recipes!

   ‚ö†Ô∏è The database will be 2 different APIs, one for food and one for drinks.

   The layout focuses on mobile devices, so all prototypes will be developed on smaller screens.
</details>

# Guidelines

<details>
   <summary><strong>‚ÄºÔ∏è Before you start developing</strong></summary><br />

   1. Clone the repository

   - Use the command: `git clone git@github.com:tryber/sd-024-a-project-recipes-app.git`.
   - Go to the repository folder you just cloned:
     - `cd sd-024-a-project-recipes-app`
   - Go to your group branch:
     - `git checkout main-group-XX && git pull`, where `XX` is your group number. Examples: `main-group-1`, `main-group-22`.

   2. Install dependencies and initialize the project

   - Install dependencies:
     - `npm install`
   - Initialize the project:
     - `npm start` (a new page should open in your browser with plain text)
  
   3. Make changes separated by new branches created from the `main-group-XX` branch, creating a new branch for each demand

   - Check that you are on the `main-group-XX` branch
     - Example: `git branch`
   - If not, switch to the `main-group-XX` branch
     - Example: `git checkout main-group-XX && git pull`
   - Now, create a branch for the demand you will develop for your project
     - You must create a branch with a brief description of the demand to be developed
     - Example: `git checkout -b main-group-XX-create-search-field`

   4. Add changes to Git _stage_ and `commit`

   - Check that the changes are not yet in _stage_
     - Example: `git status` (new changes should be listed in red)
   - Add the new file to Git _stage_
     - Example:
       - `git add .` (adding all changes - _that were in red_ - to the Git stage)
       - `git status` (new changes should appear listed in green)
   - Make the `commit`
     - Example:
       - `git commit -m 'create search component'` (making the first commit)
       - `git status` (a message like _nothing to commit_ should appear)

   5. Add your branch with the new `commit` to the remote repository

   - Using the previous example: `git push -u origin main-group-XX-creates-search-field`

   6. Create a new `Pull Request` _(PR)_

   - Go to the _Pull Requests_ page of [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tryber/sd-024-a-project-recipes-app/pulls)
   - Click on the green _"New pull request"_ button
   - Click on the _"Compare"_ checkbox and choose your branch **carefully**
   - Put a title for your _Pull Request_
     - Example: _"[GROUP XX] Create search screen"_
   - Click on the green _"Create pull request"_ button
   - Add a description for the _Pull Request_ and click the green _"Create pull request"_ button
   - **Don't worry about filling out anything else for now!**
   - Go back to the [repository's _Pull Requests_ page](https://github.com/tryber/sd-024-a-project-recipes-app/pulls) and check that your _Pull Request_ is created
   
   7. Once approved by at least one person in your group and the _Linter_ is supported, access **YOUR** _Pull Request_ and click on the _"Merge pull request"_ button

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>‚å®Ô∏è During development</strong></summary><br />

   - ‚ö† **REMEMBER TO CREATE ALL FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER WITH YOUR NAME** ‚ö†

   - Commit changes you make to the code regularly

   - Remember to always after one (or a few) `commits` update the remote repository

   - The commands you will use most frequently are:
     1. `git status` _(to check what is in red - out of stage - and what is in green - on stage)_
     2. `git add` _(to add files to the Git stage)_
     3. `git commit` _(to create a commit with the files that are in the Git stage)_
     4. `git push -u origin branch-name` _(to push the commit to the remote repository the first time you `push` a new branch)_
     5. `git push` _(to push the commit to the remote repository after the previous step)_

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>ü§ù After finishing development (optional)</strong></summary><br />

   To signal that your project is ready for _"Code Review"_, do the following:

   - Go to the **YOUR** _Pull Request_ page, add the _"code-review"_ label and tag your colleagues:

     - In the menu on the right, click on the _link_ **"Labels"** and choose the _label_ **code-review**;

     - In the menu on the right, click on the _link_ **"Assignees"** and choose **your username**;

     - In the menu on the right, click on the _link_ **"Reviewers"** and type `students`, select the team `tryber/students-sd-024-a`.

   If you have any questions, [here is an explanatory video](https://vimeo.com/362189205).

<details>
   <summary><strong>üïµüèø Reviewing a pull request</strong></summary><br />

   Use the content about [Code Review](https://app.betrybe.com/course/real-life-engineer/code-review) to help you review _Pull Requests_.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>üéõ Linter and Stylelint</strong></summary><br />

   We will use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to do static analysis of your code.

   To ensure the quality of your code so that it is more readable, easier to maintain and follows good development practices, we use the `ESLint` linter in this project. To run the linter locally in your project, run the command below:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run lint:styles
   ```

   If you still have any questions, you can consult our content on [`ESLint`](https://app.betrybe.com/course/real-life-engineer/eslint)

   **PULL REQUESTS WITH LINTER ERRORS WILL NOT BE EVALUATED. BE CAREFUL TO RESOLVE THEM BEFORE COMPLETING THE DEVELOPMENT!** ‚ö†

   You can also install the `ESLint` plugin in `VSCode`, just go to extensions and download the [`ESLint` plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>:busts_in_silhouette: Trello as a Kanban tool</strong></summary><br />

   One way for your group to organize activities and divide tasks is through a kanban model. Trybe provides a pre-configured [board for you](https://trello.com/b/RojqC6yx/app-de-receitas) to duplicate on [Trello](https://trello.com/).

   To duplicate, just follow the steps:

   - Access [board link](https://trello.com/b/RojqC6yx/app-de-receitas)
   - Open the menu in the top right corner
   - Select "copy frames"
   - Set your group team and a title for the board
   - Click `create`
   - Customize your new kanban!
</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>üõ† Tests</strong></summary><br />

   <details><summary><strong>Running requirement tests :building_construction:</strong></summary><br />
  
   For the project to be validated, all behavioral tests must pass. You can test this locally by running `npm run cy`. This command runs the Cypress test suite that validates that the overall flow and functional requirements are working as they should. You can also run the `npm run cy:open` command to have a visual result of the tests run.

   These tests do not consider the layout in general, but rather the correct attributes and information, so pay attention to that! The tests will give you an error message if they are not passing (for whatever reason). üòâ

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention:** Your application must be running for Cypress in the terminal to be able to test.
   
   ### Tip: disabling tests

   To run just one test file, you need to use the command:

   `npm run cy -- --spec cypress/integration/login_spec.js`

   **Note**: after the "spec" you need to add the entire path to the tests file.

   To run just one test, simply use the `.only` function after `describe`. With this, it will be possible for only one requirement to run locally and be evaluated.

   ![image](describe-only.png)
   ![image](only-all-green.png)

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è The automatic evaluator does not necessarily evaluate your project in the order in which the requirements appear in the readme. This is to make the evaluation process faster. So don't be alarmed if this happens, okay?
   </details>

   <details><summary><strong>Running coverage tests :open_umbrella:</strong></summary><br />
   Some requirements will ask you to develop tests for your application. These tests will be evaluated through test coverage.

   You can check the test coverage percentage with the `npm run test-coverage` command.

   You can also run `npm run test-coverage -- --collectCoverageFrom=path/of/Page` to check the percentage of test coverage for each 'Page'. For example, to check the test coverage of the `Login` page, run the command `npm run test-coverage -- --collectCoverageFrom=src/pages/Login.js`.

   * <details><summary><b> How to develop :technologist:</b></summary>

     This repository **already has a `main-group` for each group**, identified as `main-group-1` for group 1, `main-group-2` for group 2, and so on. To develop, you must always:

       * **Create your development branch from your main branch**. To do this, clone this repository, do `git checkout main-group-XX && git pull` and then `git checkout -b main-group-XX-minha-feature`.
       * To create a Pull Request to do **Code Review**, title it `[GRUPO XX] My title` and **always point your branch's Pull Request to your group's `main-group-XX` branch , as in the example below:**

     <details><summary> Example of how to point a PR to the group's main branch</summary>

       ![Example of how to point a Pull Request to the group's main branch](pull-request-para-branch-do-grupo.png)
     </details>

       * When several people develop for the same project, **merge conflicts** may occur and will need to be resolved. Pay attention to this!

       ‚ö† **ATTENTION! IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A MISTAKE IN ANOTHER GROUP'S BRANCH, SO BE VERY CAREFUL** ‚ö†

       You will see that the project requirements have, in addition to technical observations and what will be validated, descriptions such as would be seen in a real project. It is very important to be able to read descriptions like this and transform them into products or, if in doubt, know how to remove them! We remain available on Slack for this.

       This repository already contains a _template_ with a React App created, configured and with the automated tests that are part of the correction. It also has a **main-group** branch for each group, identified as `main-group-1` for group 1, `main-group-2` for group 2, and so on.

       **‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to write unit tests and feel free to change the prototype UI, just respect the `data-testid` attributes, they will be used to correct the exercise.**
     </details>

     üö® **IMPORTANT**

     To make requests, you must only use `fetch`!! Other libraries like Axios can cause problems with the evaluator.

     We recommend that requirements for the same screen be done in sequence or in parallel by people who will communicate a lot so that there are no conflicts. Requirements for the same screen with equal priorities can be done in parallel, but this will require organization on the part of the people who are dividing the task to avoid conflicts.

     * Your project requirements are automatically evaluated, using a screen resolution of `360 x 640` (360 pixels wide by 640 pixels high).

         - ‚ö†Ô∏è Therefore, it is recommended to develop your project using the same resolution, by installing [this plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en) of `Chrome` to make it easier to configure the resolution. ‚ö†Ô∏è
     </details>

   * <details><summary><b>Technical notes :information_source:</b></summary>

     Some things must follow a pre-established pattern for patch tests to work correctly.

     ‚ö†Ô∏è Read them carefully and follow exactly what is asked. Failure to comply with a requirement, in whole or in part, will impact your assessment. ‚ö†Ô∏è

     * <details><summary><b> Routes</b></summary>

       The routes to be used in the application must be the following:

       * Login screen: `/`;
       * Main screen for food recipes: `/meals`;
       * Drink recipes main screen: `/drinks`;
       * Details screen for a food recipe: `/meals/:recipe-id`;
       * Details screen for a drink recipe: `/drinks/:recipe-id`;
       * Recipe screen in food progress: `/meals/:recipe-id/in-progress`;
       * Drink recipe in progress screen: `/drinks/:recipe-id/in-progress`;
       * Profile screen: `/profile`;
       * Made recipes screen: `/done-recipes`;
       * Favorite recipes screen: `/favorite-recipes`.
       </details>
      
     * <details><summary><b> LocalStorage</b></summary>

       The use of `localStorage` is necessary so that the information is not lost if the person updates the page. The correct thing is to use the values to start your store or your context.

       In the browser's `localStorage`:

       * the `user` key must contain the following structure:
       ```js
       {
           email: person's email
       }
       ```

       * the `doneRecipes` key must contain the following structure:
       ```js
       [{
           id: recipe-id,
           type: meal-or-drink,
           nationality: nationality-of-the-recipe-or-empty-text,
           category: recipe-category-or-empty-text,
           alcoholicOrNot: alcoholic-or-non-alcoholic-or-empty-text,
           name: recipe-name,
           image: recipe-image,
           doneDate: when-the-recipe-was-completed,
           tags: recipe-tags-array-or-empty-array
       }]
       ```

       * the `favoriteRecipes` key must contain the following structure:
       ```js
       [{
           id: recipe-id,
           type: meal-or-drink,
           nationality: nationality-of-the-recipe-or-empty-text,
           category: recipe-category-or-empty-text,
           alcoholicOrNot: alcoholic-or-non-alcoholic-or-empty-text,
           name: recipe-name,
           image: recipe-image
       }]
       ```

       * the `inProgressRecipes` key must contain the following structure:
       ```js
       {
           drinks: {
               drink-id: [list-of-ingredients-used],
               ...
           },
           meals: {
               food-id: [list-of-ingredients-used],
               ...
           }
       }
       ```
       
       **Technical observations**

       * `drink-id` and `food-id` represent the ID of a drink and food, respectively, and each item in the ingredient list of the respective recipe must be represented only by the ingredient number in numeric format.
       </details>
    
     * <details><summary><b> Icons</b></summary>

       The icons to be used in the application are available in the `src/image/` directory. These icons will be used by the automated assessment tests, so make sure you use them in the requirements and do not rename them.

       The icons are:

       * `profileIcon.svg`;
       * `searchIcon.svg`;
       * `drinkIcon.svg`;
       * `mealIcon.svg`;
       * `shareIcon.svg`;
       * `whiteHeartIcon.svg`;
       * `blackHeartIcon.svg`;
       </details>

     * <details><summary><b> Library <code>clipboard-copy</code></b></summary>

       For components that contain the functionality to favorite food or drinks, you will need to use the `clipboard-copy` library to copy the recipe information. This library is already installed in the project.

       For more information, see [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipboard-copy)
       </details>

     * <details><summary><b> <code>Bootstrap</code> library (optional)</b></summary>

       For groups that want to implement styling in the app, we recommend using the `Bootstrap` lib. It is already installed by default in this project, you just need to implement it in its components. For example, if you want to implement a [button](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/buttons/):

       ``` jsx
       import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';

       const MyComponent = () => (
         <Button variant="success">
           Green Button
         </Button>
       );
       ...
       ```

# Requirements

:warning: **PULL REQUESTS WITH LINTER ERRORS WILL NOT BE EVALUATED.** :warning:

In this project, the person using the app can search for a specific recipe, explore recipes based on different criteria, favorite and make recipes, among other features.

The screens vary depending on the type of recipe (whether it is food or drink, in this case).

***Note: The way APIs must be structured follows the following models: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php and https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php***

## Unitary tests

### 1 - Develop unit tests so that coverage is at least 90%
<br />
<details>
   <summary><strong>Technical observations</strong></summary>

   * In this requirement we will cover our application with unit/integration tests using the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), take advantage of this opportunity to put it into practice [Test Driven Development](https://blog.betrybe.com/technology/tdd-test-driven-development/)

   * Remember that in Test-Driven Development, you must write the tests along with developing new features. For this reason, this requirement will only pass the evaluator as long as your application has the desired test coverage. If you add a new feature and don't create tests for it, this requirement may stop passing the evaluator.

   * The tests created by you will not influence the other requirements in the evaluator. You must develop your unit/integration tests using the React Testing Library, while the evaluator will use the [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) library to evaluate the requirements, including coverage.
